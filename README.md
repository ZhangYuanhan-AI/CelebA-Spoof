> Abstract: **CelebA-Spoof** is a large-scale face anti-spoofing dataset that has **625,537** images from **10,177** subjects, which includes **43** rich attributes on face, illumination,environment and spoof types. Live image selected from the CelebA dataset. We collect and annotate spoof images of CelebA-Spoof. Among 43 rich attributes, 40 attributes belong to Live images including all facial components and accessories such as skin, nose, eyes, eyebrows,  lip, hair, hat, eyeglass. 3 attributes belong to spoof images including spoof types, environments and  illumination conditions.CelebA-Spoof  can be used to **train and evaluate algorithms of face anti-spoofing**.

## Challenge

We host CelebA-Spoof Challenge 2020 based on the CelebA-Spoof dataset. The challenge will officially start together with [ECCV 2020 SenseHuman Workshop](https://sense-human.github.io/). [Registration](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/26210#participate) is now open. If you are interested in soliciting new ideas to advance the state of the art in real-world face anti-spoofing, we look forward to your participation! The CelebA-Spoof Challenge submission example is avaliable [here](https://github.com/Davidzhangyuanhan/CelebASpoofChallengeSubmissionExample).

## Summary

### Data Collection

We hired 8 collectors to collect spoof data and another 2 annotators to refine labeling for all data. To improve the generalization and diversity of the dataset, as shown in Figure below, we define three collection dimensions with fine-grained quantities: 

1. Five Angles: All spoof type need to traverse all five types of angles including ''vertical'',  ''down'',  ''up'',  ''forward'' and ''backward''. The angle of inclination is between [-30°, 30°].
2. Four Shapes: There are a total of four shapes, ''normal'',  ''inside'', ''outside'' and ''corner''. 
3. Four Sensors: We collected 24 popular devices with four types, ''PC'', ''camera'', ''tablet'' and ''phone''.

### Rich Annotations

Besides the annotation of Live/Spoof, Existing face anti-spoofing only annotate the spoof type. To further comprehensively investigate face anti-spoofing tasks from various perspectives, in CelebA-Spoof, we annotate 43 different annotations. 40 types of Face Attribute defined in CelebA plus 3 attributes of face anti-spoofing, including Spoof Type, Illumination Condition, and Environment.

### AENet

Based on these rich attributes, we further propose a simple yet powerful multi-task framework, namely AENet. Through AENet,we conduct extensive experiments to explore the roles of semantic informationand geometric information in face anti-spoofing.
